# Go-Guessing-Game
A guessing game made in the language Go. Made primarily to learn the Go language but also to have fun using it!

Upon starting the code, the game will ask you to type in a category (casing does not matter).
After a 3 second countdown, you will be shown some short descriptions of a character from the category and you will need to type in a relevant answer (again, casing does not matter).
You have 60 seconds to guess as many characters as you can from the category.
After the 60 seconds, you will be shown how many characters you guessed correctly.
